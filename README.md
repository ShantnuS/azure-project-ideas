## About 
The goal of this repository is to collect a diverse group of project ideas to help you learn about different resources and build something cool! 

## Contribution 
We welcome (and hope for) your contribution to this repository. If you have an Azure project idea, follow the **[Contribution Guide](Resources/Contribution.md)** to add them to the list! 

## Project Ideas 

### Artificial Intelligence 

- **Sentiment Analysis and Social Media**: Azure Cognitive Services offers powerful Sentiment Analysis tools which can help you determine if any given sentence is positive or negative. This can be combined with Azure Logic Apps to query social media sites like Twitter and determine the sentiment of certain trends and topics!

### Random/Fun

- **One Joke a Day**: There are a number of Joke APIs available, such as the [Dad Jokes API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api). Azure allows scheduled tasks to be run through several services, such as Azure Functions or Logic Apps. These tools can even be used to send messages on Teams, Slack or Emails. Try bulding a service that queries an API daily for a joke and sends it as a message!

### Security 

- **OWASP Top 10 Resilient Web App**: [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) is a collection of the current most common security risks for applications. Azure offers great Web App hosting with resources such as Azure App Service. Try building a Web App in a framework of your choice and secure it against OWASP Top 10 risks! 

### Well-Architected Framework

- **Cost Breakdown with Tagging**: Costs in an organisation are often billed across departments, and thus may require chargeback. One method to do this is by tagging Azure resources with information such as cost centre and department name and using tools such as Azure Monitor and PowerBI to create a cost/chargeback breakdown!
